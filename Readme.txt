Forward Osmosis Performance Model

This model (developed using LabVIEW) predicts the performance of forward osmosis membrane modules based on the input salinities and flows. The model divides the membrane module in small sections, and it creates the performance profile across the module.

System Requirements:

	Windows 7 SP1 or later
	1 GB RAM
	1 GB Disk space
